# rx_ls
My implementation of unix command "ls"

For this mini project I only used manpages.

# TODO:
- [x] List files and directories in a directory
- [ ] Support "ls file_name" calls
- [ ] Support the most popular flags, e.g. "ls -a", "ls -l"
- [ ] Support combining flags - e.g. "ls -la"
- [ ] Allow the user to mix the order of flags and dir/file name - both "ls -la dir" and "ls dir -la" should work
